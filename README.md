# Assignment 1 - Basic Python Programs

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1** of **Module 2: Basic Mathematical Concepts**. 
It includes basic Python programs demonstrating user input handling, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation.

## Contents

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

This program:
- Asks the user to enter two numbers.
- Performs the following operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Displays the result of each operation.

### Task 2: Concatenate First and Last Name

This program:
- Accepts the user's first and last names.
- Combines the names into a single string with a space in between.
- Displays the full name.

# Assignment 2 - Control Structures in Python

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 2** from **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**.
The programs demonstrate the use of conditional statements to check properties like whether a number is even or odd.

## Contents

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

This program:
- Accepts a number from the user and converts it into an integer.
- Checks if the number is divisible by 2:
  - If divisible, it’s an **Even** number.
  - If not, it’s an **Odd** number.
- Displays the result indicating whether the number is **Even** or **Odd**.


### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

This program:
- Initializes a variable `sum1` to store the cumulative sum.
- Uses a loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
- Adds each number to the sum.
- Displays the total sum of integers from 1 to 50.


# Assignment 3 - Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 3** from **Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**. 
The programs demonstrate the use of functions to compute values and the utilization of Python's built-in modules for mathematical operations.

## Contents

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

This program:
- Defines a recursive function `factorial(num)` to calculate the factorial of a given number.
- If the number is 0, it asks the user to enter a valid number.
- Calculates the factorial of the number and displays the result.

### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

This program:
- Imports Python's `math` module to perform advanced mathematical calculations.
- Takes a number from the user and:
  - Computes the **square root** of the number.
  - Computes the **logarithm** (natural log).
  - Computes the **sine** of the number.
- Displays the results of each operation.



## Assignment 4 - Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 4** from **Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python**. The programs demonstrate file operations like reading, writing, and appending to files, along with error handling for missing files.

### Contents

#### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

This program:
- Attempts to read the content of a file named **`sample.txt`**.
- Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
- If the file exists, the program displays its content line by line.
- If the file does not exist, the program prints an error message.

#### Task 2: Write and Append Data to `sample.txt`

This program:
- Takes user input and writes it to **`sample.txt`**.
- Appends additional predefined data to the file.
- Displays the final content of the file after writing and appending.

### Assignment 5 - Data Structures and Strings in Python
This repository contains solutions for Assignment 5 from Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python.
The programs demonstrate how to work with Dictionaries and Lists in Python, focusing on user input handling and list slicing.

### Contents
#### Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Names and Marks

This program:
- Asks the user how many student entries they would like to add.
- Accepts student names and marks as input from the user.
- Adds each student's name and marks to the dictionary.
- After collecting all entries, the program displays the final dictionary of students and marks.
- Allows the user to search for a specific student's marks by entering their name.

### Task 2: Demonstrating List Slicing

This program:
- Initializes a list, my_list, with numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements from the list.
- Reverses the extracted elements using list slicing.
- Displays both the extracted and reversed lists.
